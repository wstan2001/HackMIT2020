# HackMIT2020Project
The goal of this project is to provide a more informative experience for people in North Carolina going to the polls this voting season! Just go to the website, find a polling location near you, and see what other people have said about how long lines are. Furthermore, you have the opportunity to help out other voters by inputing how long it took you to make it through the line.
